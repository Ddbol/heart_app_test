Bootcamp class exercise - Streamlit, Docker and unit testing. 

Deployed first to streamlit url https://heartapptest-ddbol.streamlit.app/ using neural network model. Later deployed to docker with SVM classifier model https://hub.docker.com/r/dboland717/heart_pred.

Files provided by instructor and deployment completed by students/me. 
(.ipynb - code and model generation, .csv - input data, .keras/.pkl - exported models/scalers, requirements.txt & dockerfile - docker deployment, .png - image for app, heart_model. . .py - application, testing.py = unittesting)
unittest_heart_model_fixes.py - unit test for streamlit url, modified by me to work with neural network output. original testing.py from instructor to work with svm model.
